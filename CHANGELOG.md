SHORT FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------

- Tree functions execute piped commands (grep, awk) on local system  when launched on remote slave which can cause more bandwith usage

FAR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------

- MultiMaster support
	- Rethink of .osync_workdir/state/* files with PIDs, Host and Task Names to better identify multiple instances on the same fileset
	- Improve Master / Slave schema to Multimaster schema
	- State files should exist per replica for Multimaster schema

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

- RC3 is tested against Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS X. More testing needed in MSYS Windows environment.
- Cannot finish sync if one replica contains a directory and the other replica contains a file named the same way (Unix doesn't allow this)

UNDER WORK
----------

- sync test automation
- See if find command could use -delete instead of exec rm (must check compat for BSD and MacOS)
- Partial download is still experimental and needs more testing.
- Check the conflct backup and soft delete cleanup again

RECENT CHANGES
--------------
 
- Prevent debug mode to send alert emails
- Fixed an infamous bug introduced with exclude pattern globbing preventing multiple exludes to be processed
- Fixed an issue with empty RSYNC_EXCLUDE_FILES
- Lowered default compression level for email alerts (for low end systems
- Prevent exclude pattern globbing before the pattern reaches the rsync cmd
- Fixed some missing child pids for time control to work
- Prevent creation of a sync-id less log file when DEBUG is set
- Added a sequential run batch script that can rerun failed batches
- Fixed an issue where a failed task never gets resumed after a successfull file replication phase
- Added experimental partial downloads support for rsync so big files can be resumed on slow links
- Added the ability to keep partial downloads that can be resumed on next run (usefull for big files on slow links that reach max execution time)
- Moved msys specific code to Init(Local|Remote)OSSettings
- Added a patch by igngvs to fix some issues with Rsync Exclude files
- Added a patch by Gary Clark to fix some issues with remote deletion
- Minor fixes from obackup codebase
- Added compression method fallback (xz, lzma, pigz and gzip)
- Removed unused code
- Fixed remote OS detection when a banner is used on SSH

- Fixed an issue with MacOSX using rsync -E differently than other *nix (Thanks to Pierre Clement)
- Multislave asynchronous task support (Thanks to Ulrich Norbisrath)

- Fixed soft deletion not happening with relative paths
- Improved process termination behavior
- More code merging and cleanup
