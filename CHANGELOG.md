NOTES FOR MY FUTURE SELF
------------------------

Have this kind of info written to state dir.
inotifywait -m -r -e moved_from -e moved_to -e delete /home/git/osync/dir2/

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

- Cannot finish sync if one replica contains a directory and the other replica contains a file named the same way (Unix doesn't allow this)
- Soft deletion does not honor exclusion lists
- Permissions aren't set right when setfacl / chmod only is used and the file is not modified (WIP for v1.1)
